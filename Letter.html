        My dearest Aya,
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy Birthday, my favorite friend and confidant!
      </p>
      <p> Thank you for staying despite our arguments and misunderstanding. I am lacking of many things to be called a
        proper human being and I’m working to improve it. That’s why I am very thankful for being understanding. I am
        here to bless you with a healthy and wonderful year ahead of you, to have a fun and exciting life, to be healthy
        in all aspects, and to wish that you will accomplish what you wanted in life.
      </p>
      <p> Once again, thank you for everything. Even if you think today is just like any other day. To me, this day is a canvas painted with beauty, all because your existence graces this world. Aya, your strength shines through, but remember, if ever you seek a helping hand, mine is here for you. Take good care of yourself, always. Your presence means the world to me.
